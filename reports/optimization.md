# Likelihood optimization

The [Dacca protocol](../experiments/dacca/README.md) defines A, B and C, their initialization, update counts and independent evaluation.

The [earlier completed comparison](../archive/README.md) contains 968 fitted parameter vectors and 37,584 individual PF evaluations. It includes the two-package paper experiment and six other packages, with their different scopes explicitly retained. Its final reports, full-range figures, optional 1.5-IQR display figures, old failed fits, low-precision scores and density-floor outcomes are preserved. PFJAX's corrected evaluation_v2 alone supplies its final scores; the superseded scores remain as history.

The new experiment has a different status:

| Package | New endpoints | State |
|---|---:|---|
| Cuthbert | 0/36 | PF forward agreement accepted; numerical gradient differences retained separately. A/B/C not submitted; runtime and revised submission plan unresolved |
| PFJAX | 0/36 | Dependent formal job cancelled before starting after GPU validation failure |
| PyDPF | 0/36 | Dependent formal jobs cancelled before starting after GPU validation failure |
| TFP | 0/36 | Dependent formal jobs cancelled before starting after GPU validation failure |
| particles | 24/24 | Fits and independent scores audited; final new figures and reproducibility archive still pending |

For new particles, the median independent log likelihood is −4169.070668 for A (1800-second external Nelder-Mead) and −3784.099127 for B (900-second public IF2, then Nelder-Mead to the same total budget). B is higher in all twelve observed pairs. Precision passes are 9/12 for A and 12/12 for B; A tasks 0, 2 and 12 reached R=288 and remain low precision. There were no failed fits or density-floor scores. These findings apply to the recorded starts and budgets, not universal optimizer superiority.

The new particles fits used 43,647 CPU seconds, plus 155 CPU seconds for the earlier checks. Independent A40 scoring used 96 seconds and is counted separately. [Audit](../results/particles/audit.json) · [24 endpoint records](../results/particles/endpoints.csv).

Cuthbert's forward-PF agreement is accepted for proceeding with the empirical experiment; the [gradient-test review](gradient_tests_20261101.md) explains why its uncalibrated elementwise threshold is not a sufficient standalone reason to stop. Derivative correctness is not being certified. In v3, measured IF2 and gradient calls gave a conservative estimate of 3419.47 seconds per case, above the existing 3120-second submission limit. This is an estimate, not an observed complete optimization time. A feasible budget and an explicitly revised submission protocol are still required; the frozen driver, failed-job record and original limits have not been changed.
